Hi!, my name is Jonathan Guillermo, I'm mobile app developer with a couple years of experience in Android, ios and hybrid apps with Ionic. 

I enjoy learning new things and tools to improve my development skills, I love going to the movies two times peer week, Netflix Sundays, take a beer with friends and practice basketball in free time.

I started this blog with the hope that it will be helpful for people who start developing mobile apps and loves to learn new things.
